# Deep Learning Model from Scratch

This repository contains an implementation of a deep learning model built from scratch using Python and NumPy. The project aims to provide a fundamental understanding of deep learning by implementing key components without relying on high-level libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## Features
- Implement a fully connected neural network from scratch
- Forward and backward propagation
- Activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Softmax)
- Loss functions (Mean Squared Error, Cross-Entropy)
- Optimization using Gradient Descent
- Training and evaluation on sample datasets
